# Ethnikos_Organismos_Emvoliasmou

"Ethniko Organismos Emvoliasmou" is a project made by me, for the subject of "Online Programming" in the Department of Digital Systems (University Of Piraeus).

It contains the files below:
- Web_App (Directory): A directory containing all the files needed to run the Web Application.
- Report.pdf: A report for the project in the Greek Language, containing information on how to use it and how it was made.

This project was made using HTML, CSS, JS (JQuery, Ajax) and the Bootstrap Framework.

To Run the application, download the files of the project, extract them and then just go to the file below:

- Web_App/index.html

You are now ready to browse the site :)
